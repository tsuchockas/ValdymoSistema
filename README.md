Server side part of my Bachelor thesis project. This webapp is a prototype for a building's lighting network control with power usage monitoring capabilities. There are 3 types of user:
  Administrator
  Operator
  User
Users can only turn lights on and off, and check their current statuses. Operators have the same use cases as users but can also check the power usage of rooms, check light burout history and recieve email notifications when a light is malfunctioned. Administrators have the same use cases as operators (but they don't recieve emails) and can assign lights to users for them to control.
